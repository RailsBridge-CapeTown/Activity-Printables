# Activity-Printables

This repo contains [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com/)-flavoured markdown files and the exported PDFs.

Print these out instructions and put them up on the wall so that peeps don't have to remember what they should be doing. Have one thing-to-do per page so that it's clear what the current step is.

## Kinesthetic-ish stuff

People remember things more easily, and for longer, when it's linked to a physical movement. Also it is a bit silly and fun for an opener :). When we do the Intro to Rails overview and the Front-end overview, we use hand signs (and ask attendees to do them too) for each bit.

### Intro to rails

- Ruby: make a triangle with both hands (like a bit of the [ruby logo](./img/ruby-logo.jpg)).
- Rails: make one curved hand (like the [Rails logo](./img/rails-logo.jpg)).
- Git: make a wonky V pointing up (like the [Git logo](./img/git-logo.png), but upside down).
- Heroku: make a cloud shape with your hand, **above your head**.

### Front-end

- HTML: put one hand on top of the other, in front on your stomach (the content, the base)
- CSS: point both hands up at shoulder level, like you're saying "the fish was this big" (the next layer, the  presentation)
- JS: wiggle your fingers above your head (the last layer, sprinkled on top, interaction.)
